  abstract = {A tip-tilt-piston micromirror array based on electrothermal bimorph actuation is presented. The micromirror uses a compactly folded actuator design that can realize high fill-factor with a simple fabrication process. A 4 {\texttimes} 4 micromirror array with sub-apertures of 0.9 mm and a fill-factor of 54\% is demonstrated. A piston actuation of about 200 \ensuremath{\mu}m and tip-tilt scanning of \ensuremath{\pm}18{\textdegree} optical angles are obtained at a driving voltage as small as 4.5 Vdc. The mirror's tip-tilt steering capability and piston control make it promising for optical phased array applications. The phased array concept is demonstrated by phasing two adjacent mirrors on the mirror array. Other device characterizations including frequency, transient response, and mirror surface quality are also reported.},

The improvement was especially significant for the piston type MMA. Direct phase measurement methods (Shack-Hartmann sensor and interferometry) are superior when time is critical or when strong aberrations are present. The advantage of iterative methods (direct search algorithm and genetic algorithm) is the simple experimental setup and the unnecesity of calibration. These methods performed especially well with small aberrations.},

  abstract = {We present the characterization and the optimization of the phase and amplitude modulation of a liquid crystal display (LCD) applied to holographic data storage. We discuss the main LCD modulation regimes demanded in the literature in the application to holographic memories: binary amplitude, binary phase and hybrid ternary modulation (HTM). We show how to obtain optimally these modulation regimes with a LCD. In our strategy it is essential the accuracy demonstrated by the model we use to describe the modulation properties of the LCD. This accuracy allows for a reliable computer search of the configurations enabling for an optimum LCD complex amplitude modulation. Results are given for the calibration of a commercial LCD. Optimum configurations close to the ideal for each of the modulation regimes are also obtained and the values of the various parameters characterizing the quality of these configurations are provided. We have also analyzed the performance of these configurations to perform the Fourier transform (FT) of a binary data page. We see that the optimum configurations obtained for the binary phase and the HTM regimes produce a homogeneous distribution of the energy in the Fourier plane with no DC peak},

There is an extensive discussion of the symmetrical, macroscopic, dynamic, and defective properties of smectics and columnar phases, with emphasis on order-of-magnitude considerations, all illustrated with numerous descriptions of experimental arrangements. The final chapter is devoted to phase transitions in smectics, including the celebrated analogy between smectic A and superconductors.

In particular, we study the optical properties of molecules near either edge of the LCD that are unable to twist and tilt under the application of an external elec- tric field. The properties of these layers can be deduced from the inten- sity transmittances measured using different configurations of the exter- nal linear polarizers. The agreement between the theoretical and the experimental transmittances is excellent, thus enabling the prediction of the actual modulation for any configuration of the polarizers.},

  abstract = {The polarization of light is one of the most remarkable phenomena in nature and has led to numerous discoveries and applications. The nature and mathematical formulation of unpolarized light and partially polarized light were not readily forthcoming until the 1950s, when questions about polarized light and the mathematical tools to deal with it began to be addressed in earnest. As a result, there is a very good understanding of polarized light today. The primary objective of this Field Guide is to provide an introduction to the developments in polarized light that have taken place over the past half-century and present the most salient topics of the subject matter such as Mueller matrices, Stokes polarization parameters, and Jones matrices.},
