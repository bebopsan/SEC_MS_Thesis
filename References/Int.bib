The micromirror uses a compactly folded actuator design that can realize high fill-factor with a simple fabrication process. A 4 {\texttimes} 4 micromirror array with sub-apertures of 0.9 mm and a fill-factor of 54\% is demonstrated. A piston actuation of about 200 \ensuremath{\mu}m and tip-tilt scanning of \ensuremath{\pm}18{\textdegree} optical angles are obtained at a driving voltage as small as 4.5 Vdc. The mirror's tip-tilt steering capability and piston control make it promising for optical phased array applications. The phased array concept is demonstrated by phasing two adjacent mirrors on the mirror array. Other device characterizations including frequency, transient response, and mirror surface quality are also reported.},

The improvement was especially significant for the piston type MMA. Direct phase measurement methods (Shack-Hartmann sensor and interferometry) are superior when time is critical or when strong aberrations are present. The advantage of iterative methods (direct search algorithm and genetic algorithm) is the simple experimental setup and the unnecesity of calibration. These methods performed especially well with small aberrations.},

  abstract = {We present the characterization and the optimization of the phase and amplitude modulation of a liquid crystal display (LCD) applied to holographic data storage. We discuss the main LCD modulation regimes demanded in the literature in the application to holographic memories: binary amplitude, binary phase and hybrid ternary modulation (HTM). We show how to obtain optimally these modulation regimes with a LCD. In our strategy it is essential the accuracy demonstrated by the model we use to describe the modulation properties of the LCD. This accuracy allows for a reliable computer search of the configurations enabling for an optimum LCD complex amplitude modulation. Results are given for the calibration of a commercial LCD. Optimum configurations close to the ideal for each of the modulation regimes are also obtained and the values of the various parameters characterizing the quality of these configurations are provided. We have also analyzed the performance of these configurations to perform the Fourier transform (FT) of a binary data page. We see that the optimum configurations obtained for the binary phase and the HTM regimes produce a homogeneous distribution of the energy in the Fourier plane with no DC peak},

  abstract = {Experimental high-quality optical vortices of different topological charges are generated by using a vortex producing lens with two phase levels. In our setup, the lens is displayed on a liquid-crystal spatial light modulator that only attains phase modulation of around 1.2\ensuremath{\pi}. This achievement opens the real possibility of creating high-quality optical vortices with devices of very low phase modulation capacity. The experimental setup is fully described, and the considerations to set the optimal parameters to obtain high-quality optical vortices are discussed and experimentally established. The phase and intensity of the optical vortices are recovered. The phase is obtained through a phase-shifting method that is directly programmed onto the modulator avoiding any class of mechanical displacement.},

The algorithm is based on a least-squares iterative procedure, but it copes with the limitation of the existing iterative algorithms by separating a frame-to-frame iteration from a pixel-to-pixel iteration. The algorithm provides stable convergence and accurate phase extraction with as few as three interferograms, even when the phase shifts are completely random. The algorithm is simple, fast, and fully automatic. A computer simulation is conducted to prove the concept.},

This is a manifestation of an aspect of quantum mechanics known as quantum non-locality. An important consequence of this is that the measurement of the state of one particle in a two-particle entangled state defines the state of the second particle instantaneously, whereas neither particle possesses its own well-defined state before the measurement. Experimental realizations of entanglement have hitherto been restricted to two-state quantum systems, involving, for example, the two orthogonal polarization states of photons. Here we demonstrate entanglement involving the spatial modes of the electromagnetic field carrying orbital angular momentum. As these modes can be used to define an infinitely dimensional discrete Hilbert space, this approach provides a practical route to entanglement that involves many orthogonal quantum states, rather than just two Multi-dimensional entangled states could be of considerable importance in the field of quantum information, enabling, for example, more efficient use of communication channels in quantum cryptography.},

Recently, attention has been directed towards the opportunities for harnessing such beams in communications. Here, we demonstrate that four light beams with different values of orbital angular momentum and encoded with 42.8 {\texttimes} 4 Gbit s-1 quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) signals can be multiplexed and demultiplexed, allowing a 1.37 Tbit s-1 aggregated rate and 25.6 bit s-1 Hz-1 spectral efficiency when combined with polarization multiplexing. Moreover, we show scalability in the spatial domain using two groups of concentric rings of eight polarization-multiplexed 20 {\texttimes} 4 Gbit s-1 16-QAM-carrying orbital angular momentum beams, achieving a capacity of 2.56 Tbit s-1 and spectral efficiency of 95.7 bit s-1 Hz-1. We also report data exchange between orbital angular momentum beams encoded with 100 Gbit s-1 differential quadrature phase-shift keying signals.

  abstract = {Internet data traffic capacity is rapidly reaching limits imposed by optical fiber nonlinear effects. Having almost exhausted available degrees of freedom to orthogonally multiplex data, the possibility is now being explored of using spatial modes of fibers to enhance data capacity. We demonstrate the viability of using the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light to create orthogonal, spatially distinct streams of data-transmitting channels that are multiplexed in a single fiber. Over 1.1 kilometers of a specially designed optical fiber that minimizes mode coupling, we achieved 400-gigabits-per-second data transmission using four angular momentum modes at a single wavelength, and 1.6 terabits per second using two OAM modes over 10 wavelengths. These demonstrations suggest that OAM could provide an additional degree of freedom for data multiplexing in future fiber networks.
A Twist on the Capacity Crunch
The rate at which data can be transmitted down optic fibers is approaching a limit because of nonlinear optical effects. Multiplexing allows data to be encoded in different modes of light such as polarization, wavelength, amplitude, and phase and to be sent down the fibers in parallel. Optical angular momentum (OAM) can provide another degree of freedom whereby the photons are given a well-defined twist or helicity. Bozinovic et al. (p. 1545) were able to transmit high-bandwidth data using OAM modes in long lengths of optical fibers, thus providing a possible route to get yet more capacity through optic fiber networks.},

In principle the operation is isotropic, i.e., all phase edges of a sample object are highlighted simultaneously, independent of their local direction. However, here we demonstrate that the symmetry can be broken intentionally by controlling the phase of the central area of a spiral phase hologram, which is displayed at a computer controlled spatial light modulator. This produces an apparent shadow effect which can be rotated at video rate. The resulting relieflike impression of the sample topography with a longitudinal resolution in the subwavelength regime is demonstrated by imaging a standard low contrast test sample consisting of a human cheek cell.},

  abstract = {We present a surprising modification of optical interferometry. A so-called spiral phase element in the beam path of a standard microscope results in an interferogram of phase samples, for which the interference fringes have the shape of spirals instead of closed contour lines as in traditional interferograms. This configuration overrides the basic problem of interferometry, i.e., that elevations and depressions cannot be distinguished. Therefore a complete sample profile can be reconstructed from a single exposure, promising, e.g., high-speed metrology with a single laser pulse. The method is easy to implement, it does not require a spatially separated reference beam, and it is optimally stable against environmental noise.},

The imaging process is achieved in a spiral modification of Fresnel incoherent correlation holography and uses a vortex impulse response function. The correlation recordings of the object are acquired in a one-way interferometer with the wavefront division carried out by a spatial light modulator. Two different methods based on applying a helical reference wave in the hologram recording and a digital spiral phase modulation in image reconstruction are proposed for edge enhancement of amplitude objects. Results of both isotropic and anisotropic spiral imaging are demonstrated in experiments using an LED as an incoherent source of light.},

Our proposal is based on processing speckled images recorded by using two different experimental set-ups. In both schemes two laterally displaced patterns are generated: one scheme allows for obtaining undecorrelated speckle distributions and the other for decorrelated ones. Vortex networks associated with speckle patterns are analyzed by employing the usual tools developed for vortex metrology. For each recorded image, a 2D pseudo-phase map is generated on the basis of the Reisz transform. Then the vortices are located, and parameterized in terms of their topological charge, eccentricity, vorticity and angles between the zero crossing lines from the real and the imaginary parts of the analytical signal. After tracking the homologous vortices onto the maps, the histograms corresponding to the coordinate displacements are analyzed. We show that histograms interpretation is prone to failure due to its high sensitivity to decorrelation. Experimental evidences are presented to support the restrictions imposed by decorrelation of actual speckles due to uniform in-plane displacements.},

The first part of the procedure is conducted as is usual in vortex metrology for uniform in-plane displacement determination. On the basis of two recorded intensity speckled distributions, corresponding to two states of a diffuser coherently illuminated, we numerically generate an analytical signal from each recorded intensity pattern by using a version of the Riesz integral transform. Then, from each analytical signal, a two-dimensional pseudophase map is generated in which the vortices are located and characterized in terms of their topological charges and their core's structural properties. The second part of the procedure allows obtaining Young's interference fringes when Fourier transforming the light passing through a diffracting mask with multiple apertures at the locations of the homologous vortices. In fact, we use the Fourier transform as a mathematical operation to compute the far-field diffraction intensity pattern corresponding to the multiaperture set. Each aperture from the set is associated with a rectangular hole that coincides both in shape and size with a pixel from recorded images. We show that the fringe analysis can be conducted as in speckle photography in an extended range of displacement measurements. Effects related with speckled decorrelation are also considered. Our experimental results agree with those of speckle photography in the range in which both techniques are applicable.},

In this work, we present an enhanced method for measuring uniform in-plane displacements, taking advantage of the capability of determining the subpixel locations of vortices and having the ability to track the homologous vortices onto a plane.

  abstract = {The Optical Vortex Metrology is based on the possibility of characterizing, through topological and morphological parameters, each one of the vortices existing in the phase of the optical field, or in a pseudo-phase obtained by means of the Hibert, Reisz or Laguerre-Gauss transforms. On this basis, it is possible tracking and pairing the homologous vortices. Then, the locations and relative displacements between the homologous vortices are determined with sub-pixel precision. Because of the statistical nature of the measurements, their quality is determined, among other factors, by the amount of available vortices per unit area. In this work, it is proposed to use the internal modulation of the speckles to generate a significant increase in the vortex density, which can be achieved by employing a double aperture pupil optical system. Simulations of the speckle distributions are presented to analyze the increase of the vortex density as a function of the distance between the apertures, and to evaluate the influence of the increment of this density in the quality of uniform in-plane displacements measurements. The results corresponding to modulated speckles are compared with those obtained with a single aperture.},

@patent{Grier2003a,
  title = {Optical peristaltic pumping with optical traps},
  url = {http://www.google.com/patents/US6639208},
  abstract = {A method of use for holographic optical traps or gradients in which repetitive cycling of a small number of appropriately designed arrays of traps are used for general and very complex manipulations of particles and volumes of matter. Material transport results from a process resembling peristaltic pumping, with the sequence of holographically-defined trapping or holding manifolds resembling the states of a physical peristaltic pump.},

  abstract = {Using an optical vortex coronagraph and simple adaptive optics techniques, we have made the first convincing demonstration of an optical vortex coronagraph that is coupled to a star gazing telescope. We suppressed by 97\% the primary star of a resolvable binary system, Cor Caroli. The stars had an angular separation of 1.9\ensuremath{\lambda}/D at our imaging camera. The secondary star suffered no suppression from the vortex lens.},
