  abstract = {A loop-like system with a Dove prism is used to generate a collinear superposition of two helical beams with different azimuthal quantum numbers in this manuscript. After the generation of the helical beams distributed on the circle centered at the optical axis by using a binary amplitude grating, the diffractive field is separated into two polarized ones with the same distribution. Rotated by the Dove prism in the loop-like system in counter directions and combined together, the two fields will generate the collinear superposition of two helical beams in certain direction. The experiment shows consistency with the theoretical analysis. This method has potential applications in optical communication by using orbital angular momentum of laser beams (optical vortices).},

Gradient-search algorithms and generalizations of the iterative-transform phase-retrieval algorithms are derived. Analytic expressions for the gradient of an error metric, with respect to polynomial coefficients and with respect to point-by-point phase descriptions, are given. The entire gradient can be computed with the number of transforms required to propagate a wave front from one end of the optical system to the other and back again, independent of the number of coefficients or phase points. This greatly speeds the computation. The reconstruction of pupil amplitude is also given. A convergence proof of the generalized iterative transform algorithm is given. These improved algorithms permit a more accurate characterization of complicated optical systems from their point spread functions.},

It is shown that both the error-reduction algorithm for the problem of a single intensity measurement and the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for the problem of two intensity measurements converge. The error-reduction algorithm is also shown to be closely related to the steepest-descent method. Other algorithms, including the input{\textendash}output algorithm and the conjugate-gradient method, are shown to converge in practice much faster than the error-reduction algorithm.

  abstract = {We propose the use of a phase-diversity technique to estimate the orbital angular momentum (OAM) superposition state of an ensemble of photons that passes through an optical system, proceeding from an extended object. The phase-diversity technique permits the estimation of the optical transfer function (OTF) of an imaging optical system. As the OTF is derived directly from the wave-front characteristics of the observed light, we redefine the phase-diversity technique in terms of a superposition of OAM states. We test this new technique experimentally and find coherent results among different tests, which gives us confidence in the estimation of the photon ensemble state. We find that this technique not only allows us to estimate the square of the amplitude of each OAM state, but also the relative phases among all states, thus providing complete information about the quantum state of the photons. This technique could be used to measure the OAM spectrum of extended objects in astronomy or in an optical communication scheme using OAM states. In this sense, the use of extended images could lead to new techniques in which the communication is further multiplexed along the field.},

PD can work with extended incoherent images and, in an adaptive optics system, does not need extra hardware in addition to the deformable mirror. For these reasons, PD should be well suited to aberration measurement in microscopy applications. But, in biological widefield microscopy, the objects being imaged are frequently three-dimensional, and the images contain out-of-focus light. In this paper, we introduce multiplane PD and show that PD can be extended to widefield imaging of three-dimensional objects. This should be particularly useful in the field of biological fluorescence microscopy where the objects are very light sensitive and the aberrations cannot easily be determined.},

We present experimental results validating new procedures of measurement and pre-compensation of the NCPA on the AO bench at ONERA. The measurement procedure is based on new refined algorithms of phase diversity. The pre-compensation procedure makes use of a pseudo-closed loop scheme to overcome the AO wavefront sensor model uncertainties. Strehl Ratio obtained in the images reaches 98.7\% @ 632.8 nm. This result allows us to be confident of achieving the challenging performance required for extrasolar planet direct observation.},

  abstract = {We have implemented a least-squares technique for recovering phase 
information from simultaneously recorded focused and defocused images.
The inversions are made from small subfields in order to deal with
anisoplanatic image formation, such as occurring through the Earth's
atmosphere. Parameters corresponding to the alignment of the
focused-defocused images are determined simultaneously with aberration
parameters. Simulations show that the method can recover wavefronts of
up to 1/2 wave rms and that 15-21 Zernike coefficients can be obtained
from 3"x3"-5"x5" solar granulation images using a 50 cm telescope and
with noise levels of 0.4\% of the average intensity. In general, the
accuracy of the restored images is better than expected from the number
of Zernike polynomials used to represent the wave front. We have applied
the method to sequences of 100 8-bit solar granulation images obtained
with the Swedish Vacuum Solar Telescope (SVST) in La Palma using
subfields of 3"x3"-5"x5". These data enable a number of consistency
tests, all of which demonstrate that the technique works on real data.
Using averaged images obtained from each sequence we find that derived
alignment parameters are consistent to within 0.02" and that wavefronts
derived from different subfields and different sequences recorded close
in time are virtually identical. The wavefronts derived from averaged
images are also virtually identical to the average of wavefronts derived
from individual images. These measurements of telescope aberrations
suggest that astigmatism and coma are the major aberrations. These
aberrations vary with time in a way which is consistent with a major
contribution from the telescope objective and/or the first folding
mirror of the alt-az tower telescope. Wavefronts derived from individual
images show 50-90\% correlation between Zernike coefficients 4-14 derived
from nearby but independent subfields. Mosaics of 13 x 11 independently
derived wavefronts from single images show smooth variations across a
12"x10" field-of-view. These results are consistent with the impression
that degradation of image quality is more or less uniform across the
image. Restored images in a sequence show a high degree of consistency
and much more fine structure than the corresponding observed images, but
occasional fringe-like artifacts can be seen. Using the results of two
inversions to restore the scene removes such artifacts. We conclude that
this technique provides adequate wavefront information on telescopic and
atmospheric wavefront aberrations and substantial improvements in image
quality. The ease of implementation as well as its tolerance to
experimental errors and low cost makes it an excellent complement to or
even substitute for adaptive optics for many applications. The technique
is particularly well-suited for solar telescopes, where wavefront
sensing over a large field-of-view is important.},

Organized into three parts, the book covers principles, methods, and applications of adaptive optics for biological imaging, providing the reader with the following benefits:  Gives a general overview of applied optics, including definitions and vocabulary, to lay a foundation for clearer communication across disciplines Explains what kinds of optical aberrations arise in imaging through various biological tissues, and what technology can be used to correct for these aberrations Explores research done with a variety of biological samples and imaging instruments, including wide-field, confocal, and two-photon microscopes Discusses both indirect wavefront sensing, which uses an iterative approach, and direct wavefront sensing, which uses a parallel approach Since the sample is an integral part of the optical system in biological imaging, the field will benefit from participation by biologists and biomedical researchers with expertise in applied optics. This book helps lower the barriers to entry for these researchers. It also guides readers in selecting the approach that works best for their own applications.},
